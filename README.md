# my-gitpod-flutter


my attempt to get flutter working. This uses a gitpod that is setup for apache cordova, ionic, capacitor, electron mainly because it pre-installs the android sdk.



For a fresh gitpod click (under development Nov 11, 2019, working nov 13th)

https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-flutter

or use a pre-made snapshot (made on nov 13th, 2019)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#snapshot/0ee932d3-1a3a-4212-ad4c-0501a16644a2)




```
flutter create myfolder

cd myfolder

flutter run -d web --web-port 8000
```
