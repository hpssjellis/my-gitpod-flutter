# my-gitpod-flutter


my attempt to get flutter working. This uses a gitpod that is setup for apache cordova, ionic, capacitor, electron mainly because it pre-installs the android sdk.



For a fresh gitpod click (under development Nov 11, 2019)

https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-flutter



```
flutter create myfolder

cd myfolder

flutter run -d web --web-port 8000
```
